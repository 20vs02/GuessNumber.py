At first you enter a mode and simultaneously you get an amount of tries. To enter a mode, please consider:
Mode:        Number of tries:
Normal       12
Challenge    8
Monster      6 
A try is a question, in which the entered number is greater or less or equal to the random number
You win, if you found the number before your tries run out
You lose, if you did not find the number before your tries run out''')
